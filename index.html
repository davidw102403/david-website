        <p1 class="about">
            I'm a first-year undergraduate student studying Computer Engineering 
            at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm curious about 
            high-frequency trading and building complex systems that scale efficently. 
            Outside of class, I enjoy weight-lifting, web-design, animation, and reading.

            Check out my <a class="blogLink" href="/blog.html">blog</a> if you're 
            interested in math and computer science. If not, you can play with some of 
            the <a class="projectsLink" href="/projects.html">cool stuff</a> I've made. 
            And if you're here for cookies, I'm sorry to disappoint you - I haven't 
            quite figured out how to teleport baked goods through the internet just yet.
