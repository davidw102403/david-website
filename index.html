            I'm currently a first-year undergraduate student studying 
            Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
            Check out my blog if you're interested in math and computer science. 
            If not, you can play with some of the cool stuff I've made. 
            And if you're here for cookies, I'm sorry to disappoint you - 
            I haven't quite figured out how to teleport baked goods through the internet just yet.
